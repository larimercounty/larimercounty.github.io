# WEB-RESS-Public-Admin-Assests

This system is based on angularjs and php. It interacts with our ArcGIS Web services and uses MailChimp API to send information to subscribers.

There are three sections that have different homes:

*road_closures:*
road_closures lives at http://larimer.org/road/road_closures/

An angular application that reads from ArcGis Servers to yield and embeded map and tabular view of Larimer Road and Bridge Events. The system also provides and RSS feed that is read weekly (Thursday at 6pm) by MailChimp to send out updated RESS - Road Event system Status Updates. A second RSS feed is used daily by Mailchimp to provide RESS admins a notification of expired events.

*projects:*
projects lives at http://larimer.org/engineering/projects/
Also an angular application, built in a similar fashion but reads capital project data from the RESS system

*ress-dashboard:*
ress-dashboard lives at http://bboard/ress-dashboard

A similar system to the public visible road closures, RESS Dashboard provides admins additional data on evens, as well as allows them to see status and engagement on recent notifications send from the system, as well as send immediate updates on events.
